DMAP (Direct Memory Access Parsing)
===================================

This is a Ruby implementation of DMAP (Direct Memory Access Parsing),
as originally implemented in Common Lisp by Will Fitzgerald. 

It provides a simple semantic memory system (providing abstractions
and features), and a parse-to-memory parser.

The Common Lisp version can be found at:

http://www.entish.org/code/icp/

This is a work in progress -- not ready for use.
